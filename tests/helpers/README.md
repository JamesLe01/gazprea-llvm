this directory contains two utility programs
1. testsplit.py, splits every test-source
2. cleansplit.py, cleans every test cases in input/ inStream/ and output/ directories but leaves the folders there
4. memchk.py, runs test cases in ./tests/ similar to tester. It can check the memory leak of the program.
